## Authors - Disclaimer
Due to changing approaches to our system, we did not have strict responsibilities for each member and functionality. 
There are fragments in our code that were written by a single team member, however there are also classes and functions
multiple team members worked on, with up to 5-6 people per class. 
<br/>
Hence, we decided not to indicate the authors of the code everywhere.
You can see who worked on which functions, classes and components, if you clone this project from our GitHub repository.
